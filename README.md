# hello-world

Hi GitHub,

Megabytes here! I don't know how to code Javascript, but I understand some mark-up languages and can read DTD. I'm taking up an Introduction Website Development and while I'm doing my very basic website, I'm searching about creating website that's why Free Code Camp came up on my search. (Thank you!).
